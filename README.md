## What is SIEM?

**SIEM** stands for **Security Information and Event Management**. It's a security tool that collects and analyzes activity from various sources across an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure. SIEM tools enable real-time monitoring, event correlation, and incident detection, providing insights into potential threats and security incidents.

## Setting Up Splunk

Splunk is a powerful platform for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data from various sources.

## Setting Up Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native SIEM and SOAR (Security Orchestration Automated Response) solution for intelligent security analytics.

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have an **Azure Subscription**. Set up a free account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

2. **Set Up Sentinel**:
   - Open the Azure Portal.
   - In **Azure Sentinel**, create a Sentinel instance by selecting your workspace and region.

### Basic Configuration

- **Connect Data Sources**:
  - In the Azure Sentinel dashboard, go to **Data connectors**.
  - Choose from connectors like Azure Active Directory, Office 365, Firewalls, or custom logs, and follow the setup steps.

## Basic Operations

### Adding Data Sources

- **Splunk**: Use the **Add Data** wizard to connect data sources such as directories, cloud services, or databases.
- **Sentinel**: Use **Data connectors** to add Azure-native data, custom logs, or external sources.

### Creating Alerts

- **Splunk**:
  - Go to **Search & Reporting**, create a query for your target events, save the search, and enable alerts for specific conditions.

- **Microsoft Sentinel**:
  - Navigate to **Analytics**, use rule templates, or create custom rules to set alerts for conditions like login failures or suspicious IP activity.

### Dashboards and Reporting

- **Splunk**:
  - Use **Dashboards** to create custom visualizations based on your data.
  - Add charts, tables, and other visualizations for data insights.

- **Sentinel**:
  - In **Workbooks**, select from pre-built templates or create custom workbooks for visualizing alerts, incident trends, and other metrics.
